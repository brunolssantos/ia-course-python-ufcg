características.\n","\n","Para realizar a atividade, siga os seguintes passos:\n","\n","* Separe o conjunto de dados em treino e teste na proporção 80%/20% respectivamente.\n","* Utilize variáveis dummies para representar variáveis categóricas.\n","* Treine dois modelos de classificação, vistos até então, sobre o conjunto de treinamento.\n","* Teste os modelos com o conjunto de teste.\n","* A partir das predições, obtenha as matrizes de confusão e informe qual a eficácia dos modelos através das seguintes métricas: acurácia, precisão, revocação, informedness e markedness.\n","* Analise os resultados para os dois modelos e informe qual o modelo conseguiu prever melhor os
